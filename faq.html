	<li>When/where will it be?</li>
	<p>3 June 2017 - at OHSU Collaborative Life Science Building - Portland, OR</p>

	<li>Are there discounts for students?</li>
	<p>Yes! Tickets for students are only $5. But don't worry if you're not a student - tickets for everyone else are only $30.</p>
	<li>What about tickets?</li>
	<p>Tickets are on sale on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cascadia-r-conference-tickets-33779595680">Eventbrite</a> right now.</p>

	<p>We'll have coffee and snacks during breaks. For lunch, there's many options in the building and very near the building. You can also bring your lunch :)</p>

	<p>No. Tickets are cheap and so we're have everyone do their own lunch.</p>

	<h3>Bike</h3>
	<p>The location we're at is the meeting point of a few major bike routes: one going East-West, and one going North-South. So whether you're coming from downtown, North Portland, or East Portland or elsewhere, it should be convenient to get here. Here's some <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/39402">bike maps</a>. Also, Google maps obs.</p>
