	<h2>Transportation</h2>
	<h3>Bike</h3>
	<p>The location we're at is the meeting point of a few major bike routes: one going East-West, and one going North-South. So whether you're coming from downtown, North Portland, or East Portland or elsewhere, it should be convenient to get here. Here's some <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/39402">bike maps</a>. Also, Google maps obs.</p>
	<h3>Train</h3>
	<p>The location is also a nexus for a few train routes. Here's an <a href="https://ride.trimet.org/#/">interactive map</a>. Also, Google maps obs.</p>
	<h3>Walking</h3>
	<p>yay! Walking along the river is very nice if it's on your way.</p>
	<h3>Car</h3>
	<p>Parking is free at Schnitzer Lot - <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/transportation-and-parking/upload/Waterfront_Transportation_Map-2.pdf">printable map</a>. However, we encourage people to carpool if possible since there are a couple of other events that day in the building.</p>
	<h3>Flying</h3>
	<p>We imagine most people will be local-ish, but if you are flying, we have a great airport, though it's not super big so not a ton of direct flights.  You can grab a train from the airport and get all the way here. See above links for trains. Or cab/etc.</p>
	<h3>Unicycling</h3>
