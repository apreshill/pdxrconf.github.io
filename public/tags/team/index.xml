        &lt;p&gt;Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Washington DC to meet my peers in research community management as part of the inaugural class of the AAAS &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aaas.org/cefp/meet-our-fellows&#34;&gt;Community Engagement Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program, funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sloan.org/&#34;&gt;Alfred P. Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, has a mission to improve community building and collaboration in scientific organizations and research collaborations by providing a year of training and support to a cohort of scientific community managers. The Fellowship will begin in January 2017 when we 17 Fellows gather for a week-long training course with leaders in the field at AAAS headquarters. Over the next year we&amp;rsquo;ll attend monthly webinars, report on our challenges and successes, and attend mid-year and end-of-year meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cohort has already met online and the dominant theme of discussion has been how much each of us is excited to learn from the others. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to telling them about our unique rOpenSci community and to promoting open research. I encourage you to tell me what you&amp;rsquo;d like me to share with the other Fellows, tell me about your experience as part of the rOpenSci community, or tell me what you&amp;rsquo;d like me to figure out in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about this emerging profession, I recommend this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.trelliscience.com/tag/state-of-scientific-community-management/&#34;&gt;series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; on the highlights of the AAAS survey on the State of Scientific Community Management.&lt;/p&gt;
