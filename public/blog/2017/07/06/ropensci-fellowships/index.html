<p>rOpenSci&rsquo;s mission is to promote a culture of open, transparent, and reproducible research across various research domains. Everything we do, from developing high-quality open-source software for data science and, <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#ropensci-onboarding">software review</a>, to building community through events like our <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues">community calls</a> and <a href="http://unconf17.ropensci.org/">annual unconference</a> are all geared toward lowering barriers to reproducible, open science.</p>

<p>The rOpenSci Fellowship presents a unique opportunity for researchers who are engaged in open source to have a bigger voice in their communities. These fellowships are designed to support individual researchers and collaborative efforts to help them do better science, build community around projects or best practices, or develop some tools as part of ongoing research that could impact one or more research domains. Two areas that are of particular interest to us are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reproducibility</strong>
The first type of fellowship we seek to support includes any activities (software development, best practices, guidelines) that promote reproducibility with one or more research communities. Funds from this fellowship can be used for activities such as finishing development of software, documentation or developing guidelines and best practices around methods and approaches. Your proposal will need to clearly identify how these funds will impact others in your research community and beyond.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Working groups</strong>
The second type of activity we seek to support is working groups, based on <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/system/files/HamptonParker_BioSci_2011.pdf">a highly successful problem-solving model</a> pioneered by the <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a>. You propose a critical challenge in the area of scientific open source and reproducibility, and a team of experts, to collaborate intensively for a week at a time. The knowledge and insight your team develops must be broadly relevant to the research community.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our first fellowship was awarded to <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2016/12/12/ropensci-fellowship-zoon">Dr. Nick Golding</a> in suppport of a reproducibility project. Each fellowship will be in the range of $30,000 to $50,000.  We plan to award 2-3 fellowships (exact number to be determined by the size, scope, and quality of applications we receive) in 2017. We expect to have a similar call in 2018. All successful fellows will also receive additional travel support to participate in our <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017">annual unconference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fellowship-eligibility-and-criteria">Fellowship eligibility and criteria</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fellows must be affiliated with a research institution.</li>
<li>You must have Principal Investigator (PI) status at your institution to receive funds from this fellowship. If you do not have PI status, or do not expect to have PI status by the time these funds are disbursed, you will need to collaborate with someone who can fulfill this role. For this stage of the application, you will only need to list your status and if necessary, the name of person who will serve as your PI. We will request a formal letter of support in a later round.</li>
<li>Fellowship recipients must strive to spend all funds within a year of the start date. While we are able to accommodate extensions for exceptional circumstances, we strongly prefer to support projects that are scoped well enough to be completed within one year.</li>
<li>Funds can only be used to support personnel and travel. We do not allow purchase of equipment, or computing services. A detailed budget will be required in the final round.</li>
<li>Funds cannot be used to organize conferences or hackathons.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2 id="applying-for-the-fellowship">Applying for the fellowship</h2>

<p>To apply, please submit a 3-page proposal that describes your goals, expected outcomes, a tentative timeline, collaborators, and a very high level budget (no more than a paragraph or two) at <a href="https://ropensci.org/fellowships">ropensci.org/fellowships</a>. As part of your submission form, you will also have to provide details about your affiliation, PI status, and the name of your PI (if you cannot serve in that role). For applicants that make the short list, we will request a detailed budget and may also ask for additional clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Application deadline is September 1, 2017 (midnight PST).</strong></p>

<p>Questions about the fellowship are welcome at fellowships@ropensci.org</p>

<p>Expect a FAQ page shortly as we receive questions.</p>
