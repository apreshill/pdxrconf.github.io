<p>Cascadia R Conference is an R conference serving the Pacific Northwest region (Oregon/Washington/BC).</p>

<p>We've done 2 years so far: 2017 & 2018. We'll be back in 2019. See you there!</p>

<p>We wanted to run this event as there are relatively few R conferences. In addition, 
the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/">Portland R User Group</a>
is quite active, but it is hard to get together with folks from nearby cities like
Corvallis/Eugene/Seattle/etc. This event is a place to come together around R,
but also an excuse to get together with like minded people across
a larger part of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
