Cascadia R Conference is an R conference serving the Cascadia-ish region (Oregon/Washington/BC).

2017 was our first year. We're coming back in 2018. See you there!

We wanted to run this event as there are relatively few R conferences. In addition, the [Portland R
User Group](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/) is quite active, but it is hard to
get together with folks from nearby cities like Corvallis/Eugene/Seattle/etc. This event is of course
a place to come together around R, but also an excuse to get together with like minded people across
a larger part of the Cascades region.
